# Automatic Background Changer with Python
This program uses [Unsplash.com API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to change my Mac's background image automatically using Python 3.9.

## What does it do:
This program fetches an HD image from Unsplash.com API and using osascript changes your Mac's picture automatically.

## What do you need to run this script:
- Apply for a developer's account in [Unsplash's API](https://unsplash.com/developers)
- In the `full_filepath` variable, include the full filepath to the location of where `background.jpeg` will be stored.
- To use this script make a directory in your Mac and clone this project and in terminal run `python app.py` or "build" using your favorite IDE.

## Future tools that I hope to build:
- Build an option to filter which image you want
- Build an user interface for this script using `PyQt5` or `tkinter`
